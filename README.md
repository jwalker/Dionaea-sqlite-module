Dionaea Sqlite Module

The Dionaea sqlite module (DSM), is a python module that parses through Dionaea honeypots's sql files.
As development continues, more will be added to the README.md

Prerequisites:
- pysqlite - https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html

This module tracks connections, protocols stats, default passwords used in attacks, sorts unique IP address of attackers,
downloads by hashes offering original execution links, and SIP information.

DSM has a potential to keep growing as new threats and analysis techniques arise. The module was written in a generic way to illustrate what can be done once your honeypot has enough data to be processed. Any suggestions or ideas are welcome.
